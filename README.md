<h2>Introduction</h2>

 

<h2>Who are we</h2>

<p>We are a pair of game development students. </p>

 
<h2>What is the purpose of this document</h2>

<p>The purpose of this document is to write the game description and the game rules so that we will have a starting point to work from on the project. </p>

 

<h2>Why are we doing this project</h2> 

<p>We are doing this project for a multitiude of reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li> To get used to working as part of a team and not as a solo programmer/developer. </li>

<li>To increase programming skills and get used to previously foreign concepts such as pair programming.  </li>

<li>To get used to development procedures, on a fundemental level that will help us when working as teams in the future. Adhering to proper merging procedures as well as testing procedures.  </li>
</ol>

 

 

<h2>Game description</h2>

<p>2D Asteroids+ arrow keys-controlled game, which brings the user into a multiverse of Asteroidsâ€™ worlds including new power ups, galaxies to explore, sightseeing to do and more! </p>

<p> The user will be thrown inside the cockpit of a space fighter ship, with no assistance from Earth, the pilot must fight his way home through enemy territory. </p>

 

<h2>Game Rules </h2>

<ol>
<li>The user will receive 5 cells[Life source]. </li>

<li> The game ends in a loss, when the user loses cells[Life source] by battle with the enemies, colliding with the asteroids or depleting by traveling. </li>

<li> *The game never ends in a victory, because the outer space is a vast space of vacuum, continuously expanding 72km/s. </li>
