<h1> Minimal Viable Product (MVP) </h1>

<h2> Simplest Version enjoyable to the user. </h2>

<p>The MVP of the game is to have a basic space shooter where the asteroids cause obstructions for the ship and the user must shoot them causing them to explode. </p>
<p>If the user collides with the asteroid, they lose a life.  </p>

<p>Score will be kept so the user can see how well they did. 
<p>Users will be able to try to beat past scores as well as to flex against their friends.
(although there are no multiplayer features or score viewing features planned at this time)</p> 

<h2> Out of scope </h2> 
<p> The game has no multiplayer features planned, though if this version is successful enough it may be incorporated in the future </p>
<p> Saving high scores online is out of scope, and there will be no networking features. </p> 
<p> Saving game will be out of scope, but games should not go on for long enough for that to be an issue. </p>
